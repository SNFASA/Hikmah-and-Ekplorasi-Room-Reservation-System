## Database Design

The system is built around several key entities:

1. **User**

   - Includes attributes such as `name`, `email`, `role`, and `faculty/office`.
   - Relationship with `List_User` for further categorization.

2. **Booking**

   - Includes booking date, time, purpose, and associated room.
   - Relationship with `Booking_user` to link users to bookings.

3. **Room**

   - Includes attributes like `capacity` and `status`.
   - Linked with `Room_equipment` for equipment management.

4. **Equipment**

   - Includes attributes such as `name`, `category`, and `status`.

5. **Schedule Booking**

   - Tracks invalid booking times for rooms.

6. **Maintenance**

   - Tracks maintenance records for both rooms and equipment.
